# tm2md #

Note: Original code in [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/mdbenito/tm2md/src), this is my modified code.

**tm2md** is a converter to markdown format
for [TeXmacs](http://www.texmacs.org/).

It supports all (most?) of the standard Markdown syntax, plus much of
TeXmacs' non-dynamic markup. In particular, labels and references,
numbered environments and figures should work out of the box. The
major exception are tables, but this can be overcome by exporting them
to html and pasting into the markdown file.

Furthermore, several extensions specific to the static website
generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) are supported but require writing
hugo templates or using specific TeXmacs style files. See below.


## Setup ##

* Clone this repository into your `~/.TeXmacs/progs/convert` directory
  as `markdown`:

```
mkdir -p ~/.TeXmacs/progs/convert
cd ~/.TeXmacs/progs/convert
git clone https://bitbucket.org/mdbenito/tm2md.git markdown
```

* Add the line `(use-modules (convert markdown init-markdown))` to
  your `my-init-texmacs.scm`.

## To do ##

* Use TeXmacs' `logic-dispatch`.
* Clean up the mess with `with-global`.
* line-breaks and other markup in doc-data (e.g. in the doc-title)
  need to be properly handled if included in YAML metadata for Hugo.
* Support for tables.
* Inverse markdown to TeXmacs conversion.


## Hugo support ##

This has been developed for its use in a specific
website. See [here](https://bitbucket.org/mdbenito/paperwhy) for hugo
template examples and TeXmacs style files to make this work.

In addition to the standard markdown, almost everything that Hugo
supports can be converted from TeXmacs, including blackfriday
extensions like footnotes and ~~striked through text~~. Bibliography,
shortcodes and tags are also supported.
